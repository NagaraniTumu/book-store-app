    "description": "Learning Angular, Second Edition A Hands-On Guide to Angular 2 and Angular 4 Learning Angular teaches modern application development with Angular 2 and Angular 4. It begins with the basics of Angular and the technologies and techniques used throughout the book, such as key features of TypeScript, newer ES6 syntax and concepts, and details about the tools needed to write professional Angular applications. The reader will next build an Angular application from scratch while learning about the primary pieces of an Angular application and see how they work together. Using lots of examples, the core parts of Angular will be introduced, such as Components, the Router, and Services. The book also covers techniques like server-side rendering and how to incrementally add Angular 2+ features to existing AngularJS applications. Finally, the reader will gain insight into advanced skills that should be part of any professional Angular developerâ€™s toolkit such as testing, tooling options, and performance tuning. Understand how Angular is organized and learn best practices for designing Angular applications Quickly build Angular templates with built-in directives that enhance the user experience Bind UI elements to your data model, so changes to your model and UI occur automatically in tandem Define custom Angular directives that extend HTML Implement zoomable images, expandable lists, and other rich UI components Implement client-side services that interact with web servers Build dynamic browser views to provide even richer user interaction Create custom services you can easily reuse Implement rich UI components as custom Angular directives Contents at a Glance Introduction What is Angular Why Use Angular Who this Book is For How to Use this Book Getting the Source Code Chapter 1: Jumping into JavaScript Setting Up a JavaScript Development Environment Defining Variables Understanding JavaScript Data Types Using Operators Implementing Looping Creating Functions Understanding Variable Scope Using JavaScript Objects Manipulating Strings Working with Arrays Adding Error Handling Chapter 2: Jumping into TypeScript Learning the Different Types Understanding Interfaces Implementing Classes Implementing Modules Understanding Functions Chapter 3: Getting Started with Angular Why Angular?

    "description": "From Angular core team member and creator of the router About This Book Written by the creator of the Angular router, giving you the best information straight from the source Get full coverage of the entire Angular Router library and understand exactly how every command works Essential for all serious users of Angular who need to manage states within their applications Who This Book Is For To get the most from this book, you should already have a good understanding of Angular and general web development. What You Will Learn Understand the role of the Angular router and how to make the most of it Build and parse complex URLs Learn about the componentless and empty-path routes Take control of states in your application Make use of imperative navigation Understand guards and how they can benefit your applications Optimize configuration and run tests on your routing In Detail Managing state transitions is one of the hardest parts of building applications. This is especially true on the web, where you also need to ensure that the state is reflected in the URL. In addition, you might want to split applications into multiple bundles and load them on demand. Doing this transparently isn't easy. The Angular router solves these problems. Using the router, you can declaratively specify application states, manage state transitions while taking care of the URL, and load bundles on demand. This book is a complete description of the Angular router written by its designer. It goes far beyond a how-to-get-started guide and talks about the library in depth. The mental model, design constraints, and the subtleties of the API-everything is covered. You'll learn in detail how to use the router in your own applications. Predominantly, you'll understand the inner workings of the router and how you can configure it to work with any edge cases you come across in your sites. Throughout the book, you'll see examples from real-world use in the MailApp application. You can view the full source of this application and see how the router code works to manage the state of the application and define what is visible on screen. Reading this book will give you deep insights into why the router works the way it does and will make you an Angular router expert. Style and approach This is an extremely practical book full of code examples and descriptions to help you understand the inner workings of the Angular router.",

    "description": "When developers move beyond building simple web sites or small applications, things get complicated. Managing data gets messy, handling browser incompatibilities takes time, juggling competing user interactions and integrating the work of multiple developers gets tricky. The Angular framework handles these common problems, making it ideal for writing large-scale web applications that can be maintained, extended, and tested. Because it's popular, it offers a well-supported code base, vibrant community, and rich ecosystem. Best of all, Angular emphasizes performance and focuses on mobile apps by being compact and memory efficient. Angular in Action teaches readers modern application development with Angular. It begins with the basics, such as key features of TypeScript, newer ES6 syntax and concepts, and details about the tools needed to write professional Angular applications. Next, readers learn how to build an Angular application from scratch. Using many examples, the book teaches the core parts of Angular, such as Components, the Router, and Services. It also covers techniques like server-side rendering and incrementally adding Angular to existing Angular applications. Finally, if offers insight into advanced skills, such as testing, tooling options, and performance tuning. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.",
